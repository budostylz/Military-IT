## DoD Enterprise Email:  

The DoD Enterprise Email does NOT have the ability to be accessed using Outlook or other email program on a computer that is not on the .mil or .gov network.  Read the 3 lines with double dashes.  This means it cannot be set it up on a personal computer using Outlook like we once did with AKO and Mail.mil's predecessor, Advanced Technologies Email.
